Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data

This is the code for the Peer Assessed project.

Intructions:

* Download the dataset from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
* Extract it 
* Clone run_analysis.R to the same level as the extracter directory (i.e. it should be alongside the "UCI HAR Dataset" directory, not within it)
* Using the shell launch R and use the command source("run_analysis.R")

The final dataset is in the final_data.txt file, which contains a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
